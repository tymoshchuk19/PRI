                        <h2>Andromeda Galaxy</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31
                            , or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula, is
                            a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs 
                            (2.5 million light-years) from Earth, and the nearest
                            major galaxy to the Milky Way. The galaxy's name 
                            stems from the area of the Earth's sky in which it 
                            appears, the constellation of Andromeda. The virial 
                            mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of
                            magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at a trillion 
                            solar masses. The mass of either galaxy is difficult
                            to estimate with any accuracy, but it was long
                            thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more massive
                            than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%.
                            This has been called into question by a 2018 study
                            which cited a lower estimate on the mass of the
                            Andromeda Galaxy, combined with preliminary
                            reports on a 2019 study estimating a higher
                            mass of the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy
                            has a diameter of about 220,000 light-years,
                            making it the largest member of the Local
                            Group at least in terms of extension, if not mass.
                            The number of stars contained in the Andromeda
                            Galaxy is estimated at one trillion (1×1012),
                            or roughly twice the number estimated for the
                            Milky Way. The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies
                            are expected to collide in around 4.5 billion years,
                            merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large
                            lenticular galaxy. With an apparent magnitude of 3.4,
                            the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier
                            objects making it visible to the naked eye from Earth on
                            moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate
                            light pollution.

                        <h2>Antennae Galaxies</h2>
                        <p>The Antennae Galaxies are undergoing a galactic collision.
                            Located in the NGC 4038 group with five other galaxies,
                            these two galaxies are known as the Antennae Galaxies because
                            the two long tails of stars, gas and dust ejected from the
                            galaxies as a result of the collision resemble an insect's antennae.
                            The nuclei of the two galaxies are joining to become one
                            giant galaxy. Most galaxies probably undergo at least one
                            significant collision in their lifetimes. This is likely
                            the future of our Milky Way when it collides with the Andromeda Galaxy.
                            Five supernovae have been discovered in NGC 4038: SN 1921A,
                            SN 1974E, SN 2004GT, SN 2007sr and SN 2013dk.
                            A recent study finds that these interacting galaxies are less
                            remote from the Milky Way than previously thought—at 45 million
                            light-years instead of 65 million light-years.
                            They are located 0.25° north of 31 Crateris and 3.25° southwest
                            of Gamma Corvi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Antennae galaxies also contain a relatively young collection
                            of massive globular clusters that were possibly formed as
                            a result of the collision between the two galaxies.
                            The young age of these clusters is in contrast to the average
                            age of most known globular clusters, around 12 billion
                            years old, with the formation of the globulars likely
                            originating from shockwaves, generated by the collision
                            of the galaxies, compressing large, massive molecular clouds.
                            The densest regions of the collapsing and compressing clouds
                            are believed to be the birthplace of the clusters.

                        <p>
                            The Black Eye Galaxy (also called Evil Eye Galaxy
                            and designated Messier 64, M64, or NGC 4826) is a relatively
                            isolated spiral galaxy located 17 million light years away
                            in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices. It was
                            discovered by Edward Pigott in March 1779, and independently
                            by Johann Elert Bode in April of the same year, as well
                            as by Charles Messier in 1780. A dark band of absorbing dust
                            in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus gave rise to its
                            nicknames of the "Black Eye" or "Evil Eye" galaxy. M64 is
                            well known among amateur astronomers because of its appearance
                            in small telescopes.
                            This galaxy is inclined 60° to the line-of-sight and has a 
                            position angle of 112°. At the distance of this galaxy,
                            it has a linear scale of 65 ly (20 pc) per arcsecond.
                            The morphological classification of NGC 4826 in the De
                            Vaucouleurs system is (R)SA(rs)ab, where the '(R)' 
                            indicates an outer ring-like structure, 'SA' denotes a
                            non-barred spiral, '(rs)' means a transitional inner
                            ring/spiral structure, and 'ab' says the spiral arms are
                            fairly tightly wound. Ann et al. (2015) gave it a class
                            of SABa, suggesting a weakly-barred spiral galaxy with
                            tightly wound arms.
                            M64 is a type 2 Seyfert galaxy with an HII/LINER nucleus.

                            The central region is a weak source of radio emission.
                            A soft X-ray source has been detected at the nucleus,
                            which is most likely coming from the circumnuclear region
                            rather than directly from an active galactic nucleus.
                            There is an inner disk of molecular gas that is truncated
                            at a radius of 2,300 ly (700 pc). At present, the
                            non-rotational motions of this disk do not significantly
                            feed the core, but the disk does produce a vigorous rate
                            of star formation. There is also evidence of a recent
                            large inflow of mass.

                            The interstellar medium of Messier 64 consists of two
                            counter-rotating disks that are approximately equal in mass.
                            The inner disk contains the prominent dust lanes of the
                            galaxy. The stellar population of the galaxy exhibits
                            no measurable counter-rotation. Possible formation
                            scenarios include a merger with a gas-rich satellite
                            galaxy in a retrograde orbit, or the continued accretion
                            of gas clouds from the intergalactic medium. It has a

                        <p>Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a
                            spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away, with a
                            diameter of 90,000 light years, about half the size of the
                            Milky Way, in the constellation Ursa Major. Due to its
                            proximity to Earth, large size, and active galactic nucleus
                            (which harbors a 70 million supermassive black hole), Messier
                            81 has been studied extensively by professional astronomers.
                            The galaxy's large size and relatively high brightness also
                            makes it a popular target for amateur astronomers.

                        <p>NGC 4567 and NGC 4568 (nicknamed the Siamese Twins or the Butterfly Galaxies)
                                are a set of unbarred spiral galaxies about 60 million light-years away
                                in the constellation Virgo. They were both discovered by William Herschel in 1784.

                                They are part of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Only one supernova (SN 2004cc)
                                has been observed in the Siamese Twins.

                                These galaxies are in the process of colliding and merging with each other,
                                as studies of their distributions of neutral and molecular hydrogen show, with 
                                the highest star formation activity in the part where they overlap. However the 
                                system is still in an early phase of interaction.
                                They were named "Siamese Twins" because they appear to be connected.
